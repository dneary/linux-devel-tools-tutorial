I iz a grate codr, all theez progams work excellent!

Dave Neary.

Programs:

demo-gdb: Segmentation fault (core dump) - get a backtrace from a core
demo-gdb1: Implementation of a stack for parsing a "reverse polish" input 
           string of operators and floating point numbers, and calculating
           the result. Numbers are pushed onto a stack, and when an operator
           is encountered, the required number of arguments are popped, 
           the result calculated, and the result pushed back onto the stack.
           When the end of the input string is reached, the result is popped 
           off the top of the stack.
           Valid operators are: + - * /.
           The input string "2 2 *" should give the result 4. "2 2 * 5 +"
           should give 9. "2 3 * 1.2 2.7 + * 1 4 + /" should give the result 
           ( (2.7 + 1.2) * (3 * 2) ) / (4 + 1) = 4.68
demo-massif: Allocates lots of heap memory - gives useful results in Massif
demo-valgrind: Linked list implementation with lots of memory leaks, 
               and potential bugs. Also profiling issues - which we should 
               get with >100 inputs.
