gdb_example & gdb_example2
--------------------------

Examples of using gdb. Intended to be used together with Maemo Debugging Guide. 
Brief tests follow:

1. Install debug tools 
> fakeroot apt-get install maemo-sdk-debug

2. Compile the examples with debug flags:
> gcc gdb_example.c -o gdb_example -g
> gcc gdb_example2.c -o gdb_example2 -g

3. Open the first example under the debugger.
> native-gdb gdb_example

4. Set a breakpoint to function example_3
(gdb) br example_3

5. Run the example
(gdb) run
...
Breakpoint 1, example_3 () at gdb_example.c:22
22	  printf("Now in example_3()\n");

6. quit gdb
(gdb) q
The program is running.  Quit anyway (and kill it)? (y or n) y

----

example2.c is similar, but it uses the sleep() function so that it consumes
less cpu time, as it was meant to be run in the background, killed, and
then core file examined. This also demonstrates that gdb can investigate
libraries too if debug versions of them have been installed.

1. start the example 
> ./gdb_example2 &

2. kill the example with SIGSEGV signal
> kill -SIGSEGV %1

3. Examine the core file in gdb
> native-gdb ./gdb_example2 core
(gdb) bt
#0  0xb7eb4d3b in __nanosleep_nocancel () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0xb7eb4b73 in sleep () from /lib/libc.so.6
#2  0x08048430 in example_1 (x=1) at gdb_example2.c:46
#3  0x08048483 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbfc547b4) at gdb_example2.c:56
(gdb) q
 
The Maemo Debugging Guide has a more involved example that uses a core file 
produced on device.
